# hangman-game
A game where you have fun trying to guess a word, and if you don't get it you kill yourself!

## Play it for yourself!

## How to play
In order to guess a letter, just type a key on your keyboard. If the guess is correct, it will fill in the word on the screen. If it is false, it will display your wrong guesses.

## Further Development
This program uses JavaScript mainly. If you would like to update the style and look, edit the index.html and assets/css/style.css files. If you would like to add to the word library or modify the logic, edit the game.js file located in the assets/javascript directory.
